ZKit Is A Framework Written In Pure Python For Hacking . hacking is colorful .

No need for updating it manualy . zkit will check for updates everytime you run it . 

and updating it is very easy . just go to the root directory of zkit and run `python updater.py update`

you can repair your framework if you modified it . just run `python updater.py repair`

## What can it do

- It can support you for making a malware for a speciefied target . (With User-Payloads) In several ways with encrypting your malware and inserting a decode stub for decryption in runtime and some special methods for hidding malware from user in windows and linux

- Run dos attacks

- Build rootkit rverse shell

- Build file transfer payload (reverse shell rootkit features included too) both TCP and UDP

- Build Ransomware TCP and UDP

- Build KeyLogger TCP and UDP or even transfer using email

- Payload uses an encryption method and random variable names to fool the AVs . Virus total result is : 0/59

You can take a look at for installing more payloads --> [zkit-market](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Market) . nothing there you might like ? build you own and fork [ZKit-Payload-Template](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Payload-Template) and build your payload and see your payload listed in the market . [Need Tutorial](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/wiki/Creating-My-Own-Payload) !? Sure . Everything that is new needs tutorial.

## So what do i need for running it

 **You dont need much packages only** :

- scapy used for **dosing** .

- colorama for **making texts colorful** . (*no need for it in linux*)

NOTE : windows payloads have to be **compiled** to work . but **not for linux payloads** . because linux has python built-in .

 *thats it you are all done* .

with these minimium requirements you can do these amazing things want to try it ? [Get Me To Install Section](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/blob/master/README.md#installing)
