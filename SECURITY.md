# Security Policy

## What to share 

Information like `zkit-version`, `os version`, `python version`, and a screenshot from the successful attack result.
Plus information you have sent to zkit to make itself vulnerable.\
**Do not share too much sensitive information.**

## Supported Versions

Only the two latest ZKit-Framework releases are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I will test the attack vulnerability on 3 different platforms (personal): on a Windows 10, Kali, and a Fedora System. If one of the attacks is successful, the vulnerability will be accepted. If all 3 fail, it will be declined.

If you find a vulnerability that was already accepted, based on its severity, it will be patched in 1-24 hours. I will try to patch it as soon as possible unless it is a vulnerability that takes more time to patch.
